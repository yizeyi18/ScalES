It is understood that BLOPEX is currently published under the GNU
license, which is not entirely compatible with the BSD license used by
DGDFT.  

In the future, either DGDFT will convert to GNU license, or DGDFT will
implement its own version of LOBPCG and /or other eigenvalue solver(s)
to avoid the dependence on GNU license.
