INSTALLATION

1. Set environmental variable HOST.  For example, on shark run
     export HOST=shark
   on TACC, run
     setenv HOST tacc

2. Go to subdiretory SRC/ and type
     make
   If something strange happened, run
     make clean 
   first

3. C2H6 Test example
   Global: 
     Go to subdiretory ./BIN/C2H6/GLOBAL, and run
       mpirun -n 1 ../../pardgdft
     The output is written in statfile.0000
   DG:
     Go to subdiretory ./BIN/C2H6/DG, and run
       mpirun -n 2 ../../pardgdft
     The output is written in statfile.0000 and statfile.0001
     
4. To compile on TACC, the following modules are necessary
     module load fftw3 
     module load mkl
     module load intel
   
5. Change PeriodTable_Dir if the directory is moved.
   Make sure dg_lgl.bin is in the current directory if DG mode is used.

NOTE: In this branch, The binary files are now moved to ProjectBin folder, and
the binary file name is force instead of pardgdft.
